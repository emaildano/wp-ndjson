## Installation

1. Download WP Serverless Search WordPress Plugin as a Zip Archive
2. Upload to your WordPress site or blog
3. Activate

## Customizing to your Theme

The default settings for this WordPress Plugin are designed to work with the official Twenty Seventeen WordPress Theme. However, you can customize these options for custom Themes for site search forms.

1. Navigate to the WP Serverless Search WordPress Plugin Settings
2. Update Form Class to best match your theme search form.
3. Update Input Class to best match the input of the search form.

### Finding Your Form and Input Class

The best way to do this is using your browser developer tools such as Inspect Element in Chrome, Developer Tools in Safari, etc.

For example, here is the site search form HTML from the twenty seventeen WordPress Theme.

In this example, our target Form Class could be `form[role=search]`, `form.search-form`, or simply `.search-form`. You decide how specific you want to get, based on your Theme and needs.

For the Input Class, that could be any of the following: `input[type=search]`, `#search-form`, `input.search-field`, etc.

Those values may change depending on your theme.

```html
<form role="search" method="get" class="search-form" action="https://example.com/">
	<label for="search-form">
		<span class="screen-reader-text">Search for:</span>
	</label>
	<input
    type="search" id="search-form" class="search-field" placeholder="Search â€¦" value="" name="s">
	<button type="submit" class="search-submit">
    <span class="screen-reader-text">Search</span>
  </button>
</form>
```
